# Diagnostics & Quality Checks / 진단과 품질 점검

Diagnostics ensure that generated keywords remain interpretable, discriminative, and useful for
downstream analysis.

## Key Dashboards / 핵심 대시보드

| Check | Purpose | 방법 |
|-------|---------|------|
| Coverage histogram | Ensure keywords touch enough documents | `final_df['doc_cov']` 분포 확인 |
| LLR distribution | Detect overly generic terms | z-score 합계 분석 |
| Year series sparsity | Identify seasonal or noisy terms | `term_year` 요약 |
| Redundancy ratio | Monitor MMR effectiveness | Top-N 결과에서 유사도 평가 |

## Analysis Workflow / 분석 절차

1. Plot coverage histogram; if fat-tailed, adjust `min_cluster_doc_coverage`.
2. Review LLR z-scores; near-zero or negative values suggest raising coverage thresholds.
3. Inspect year-series sparsity to flag seasonal signals for domain experts.
4. Calculate redundancy ratio (unique terms ÷ total terms). Target ≥ 0.85 for top-20 lists.
5. Capture findings in a diagnostics notebook (`notebooks/kriss_clustering_demo.ipynb`) or dedicated
   report cell.

## Automation Tips / 자동화 팁

- Schedule nightly quality checks that load the latest `top_df` and emit dashboards as PNG/HTML.
- Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases) for historical trend tracking.
- Fail CI jobs when redundancy ratio or coverage median falls below agreed thresholds.

## Analyst Checklist / 분석자용 체크리스트

- [ ] Coverage median above threshold (≥ `min_cluster_doc_coverage`).
- [ ] LLR z-score mean positive for priority clusters.
- [ ] Redundancy ratio within acceptable range.
- [ ] Year-series anomalies annotated for presentation decks.
