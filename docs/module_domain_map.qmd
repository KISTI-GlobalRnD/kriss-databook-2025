# 2.1 Macro & Emerging Areas / 표준연구 지형도

Module 1 focuses on constructing a research landscape for standard science and extracting emerging
domains worth strategic investment.

## 세부 목차 / Section Outline

1. 연구지형도 구축 (Macro 레벨)
2. 유망연구영역 도출 (Meso/Micro 연결)
3. Analyst 체크포인트

## 2.1.1 연구지형도 구축 / Landscape Construction

- **Corpus Expansion**: Incorporate curated keywords, flagship journals, and citation links to avoid
  blind spots.
- **클러스터링**: Apply Leiden algorithm on citation graphs to derive coherent research areas.
- **Global ↔ Domain Views**: Build a global overlay map first, then filter to standard-research clusters
  to preserve context.
- **LLM 보조 설명**: Generate bilingual descriptions for each cluster to support analyst briefings.

## 2.1.2 유망연구영역 도출 / Emerging Area Detection

- **지표 묶음**: Growth, diffusion (파급성), influence, industrial linkage, novelty.
- **Scoring Mechanics**: Combine c‑TF‑IDF/LLR keyword signals with bibliometric metrics to prioritise.
- **LLM 리포팅**: Produce quick memos summarising why each area matters, including exemplar keywords,
  institutions, and potential applications.
- **Synthesis Artifacts**: 
  - Ranked tables by indicator weights.
  - Heatmaps comparing emerging vs. mature domains.
  - Narrative briefing decks for leadership reviews.

## 2.1.3 Analyst Actions / 분석자 체크포인트

- Validate cluster coherence before trusting indicator outputs.
- Compare emerging-area lists with KRISS strategic themes; mark overlaps and gaps.
- Archive LLM prompts/responses to ensure auditability and reproducibility.
