# 추진 전략 & 수행 개요 / Strategy & Execution

## 세부 목차 / Section Outline

1. 데이터셋 구축 로드맵
2. 글로벌 ↔ 표준연 매핑 전략
3. 모듈 간 연계 및 역할 정의

The presentation highlights a dual-track strategy: build comprehensive research landscapes and deliver
actionable institutional insights. This page maps those goals to the operational pipeline.

## Integrated Flow / 통합 연계 구조

1. **Strategy 1 – 데이터셋 구축**: Expand the corpus with standard-specific keywords, BIPM institute
   lists, core journals, and citation snowballing to capture relevant literature.
2. **Strategy 1 – 글로벌/도메인 맵 구축**: Compute similarity across the full corpus, then zoom into the
   standard-research subset using Leiden clustering and overlay mapping.
3. **Strategy 1 – 유망영역 평가**: Attach bibliometric indicators (growth, influence, industrial linkage)
   to each cluster and triage promising areas for deeper review.
4. **Strategy 2 – 성과 및 네트워크 분석**: Benchmark countries and institutes, reveal collaboration
   patterns, and contrast KRISS against peers.
5. **Strategy 2 – 포트폴리오 지원**: Package findings into dashboards, databooks, and narrative briefs
   that feed executive decisions.

## Pipeline Responsibilities / 파이프라인 역할

- **Data Engineering**: Stream ingestion, metadata enrichment, sparse aggregation (`Stage 0–1`).
- **Keyword Intelligence**: Scoring, redundancy control, canonicalisation (`Stage 2–2.5`).
- **Temporal Analytics**: Year-series replay, indicator smoothing (`Stage 3`).
- **LLM 지원**: Prompt engineering for cluster narration and emerging-area memos.
- **시각화/배포**: Overlay maps, collaboration networks, MkDocs/PBI dashboards.

Refer to `Pipeline Architecture & Flow` for implementation specifics and hand-offs.

## Governance Hooks / 거버넌스 포인트

- **Checkpoint Review** (월별): Validate cluster quality, indicator behaviour, and LLM summaries.
- **분석 블록** (격주): Module 1 vs Module 2 teams share discoveries to keep emerging-area insights
  aligned with benchmarking outputs.
- **사전 킥오프 산출물**: Scope definitions, success metrics, schedule baselines, and documentation
  plan (this site + dashboard roadmap).
