## 수행 체계 / Delivery Structure

- **주관 기관**: KRISS with KISTI analytics support for HPC, bibliometrics, and dashboard engineering.
- **핵심 역할**:
  - *Project Lead*: Aligns scope, milestones, risk mitigation.
  - *Data Engineering Squad*: Corpus curation, ingestion, pipeline maintenance.
  - *Analysis Squad – Module 1*: Landscape, emerging area evaluation, LLM summarisation.
  - *Analysis Squad – Module 2*: Benchmarking, network analysis, portfolio modelling.
  - *Experience Team*: Dashboard/databook design, stakeholder enablement.
- **협업 채널**: Weekly stand-ups, bi-weekly module syncs, monthly steering committee.

## 일정 개요 / Timeline Highlights

| 기간 | 마일스톤 | 주요 활동 |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 월 1 | Kickoff & data acquisition | Finalise scope, ingest WOS XML, confirm keyword lists |
| 월 2 | Landscape baseline | Complete clustering, initial indicators, share early maps |
| 월 3 | Emerging area review | Run coverage diagnostics, release LLM summaries, align with KRISS priorities |
| 월 4 | Benchmarking sprint | Produce percentile dashboards, collaboration networks |
| 월 5 | Portfolio synthesis | Draft scenarios, databook mock-ups, iterate with stakeholders |
| 월 6 | Final delivery | Freeze analyses, publish MkDocs site, deploy dashboard/databook |

*(Update actual dates once project plan is confirmed.)*

## 리스크 & 대응 / Risk Management

- **데이터 품질**: Maintain anomaly logs; rerun vectoriser fit if new sources added.
- **LLM 의존도**: Provide human-in-the-loop validation and fallbacks to raw metrics.
- **일정 지연**: Use mid-sprint demos to catch scope creep early.

## 산출물 체계 / Deliverable Packaging

- MkDocs site (this repository) as the canonical methodology & governance reference.
- Interactive dashboards + databook for ongoing exploration.
- Executive summary deck aligned with emerging area and portfolio findings.
