Welcome to the Quarto site for the KRISS keyword extraction pipeline. This report distils the hands-on
lessons from the clustering and c‑TF‑IDF workflow into an operational handbook.

## Executive Summary / 요약

- Deliver interpretable cluster descriptors at scale using class-based TF-IDF with optional LLR
  reinforcement.
- Persist intermediate artefacts (vectorisers, sparse matrices, candidate tables) to keep long runs
  resilient to interruptions.
